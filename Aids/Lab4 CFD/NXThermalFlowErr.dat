     Model Summary:

     Number of elements                    =     32769
     Total number of conductances          =     32768
     Number of convective conductances     =     32768

     Note: During the analysis process a number of elements have been
     created whose labels you may not recognize. To find out more about
     these elements and the elements they are associated with, please
     look on file REPF for the phrase 'TMG element'
